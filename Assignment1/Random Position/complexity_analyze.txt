Time taken to perform the Quick Sort over 100023 elements considering Random element as Pivot is 0.108521 seconds

The amount of space is used during running the program = Maximum resident set size (kbytes) [ ===> 26th line ]

Large size input data is handled by 'Array' Data Structure of Long Int type where data is read from input file and output is written back to output file

Memory release statement is present from 41th line onwards
